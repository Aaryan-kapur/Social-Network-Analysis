In Module Two you'll learn how to analyze the connectivity of a network 
based on measures of distance, reachability, and redundancy of paths 
between nodes. In the assignment, you will practice using NetworkX to 
compute measures of connectivity of a network of email communication among 
the employees of a mid-size manufacturing company.
