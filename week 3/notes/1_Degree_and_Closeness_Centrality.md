## Note Importance

__==> Q:__ What are the nodes with most importance?

__==> A:__ Different ways of thinking about "importance".
- Degrees of node
- Average proximity to other nodes
- Fraction of shortest path

## Network Centrality

Centrality measures identify the most important nodes in a network:

- Influential nodes in a social network.
- Nodes that disseminate information to many nodes or prevent epidemics.
- Hubs in a transportation network.
- Important pages on the Web.
- Nodes that prevent the network from breaking up.

Centrality Measures 
- Degree centrality 
- Closeness centrality 
- Betweenness centrality 
- Load centrality 
- Page Rank 
- Katz centrality Percolation centrality 

### ==> Degree centrality 
__Assumption:__ important nodes have many connections. 

The most basic measure of centrality: number of neighbors. 
- Undirected networks: use degree 
- Directed networks: use in-degree or out-degree
