Module One introduces you to different types of networks in the real 
world and why we study them. You'll learn about the basic elements of 
networks, as well as different types of networks. You'll also learn how 
to represent and manipulate networked data using the NetworkX library. 
The assignment will give you an opportunity to use NetworkX to analyze a 
networked dataset of employees in a small company.

## Outline
### Networks: Definition and Why We Study Them

- [Types of network](notes/1_type_of_different_networks.md)
- [Application of network analysis](notes/2_application_of_network_analysis.md)
- Summary:
    - Many complex structures can be modeled by networks.
    - Studying the structure of network can allow us to answer question about
complex phenomena.
